7th Hero is a web application that allows users to discover and get started with the 7th Sea game, a role-playing game of adventure and exploration. If you want to learn more about this world, I suggest you visit: https://septimomarrev.wixsite.com/revolution

The developed app allows users to create heroes (the main characters of the 7th Sea universe) with random characteristics while adhering to the rules of the core manual. Users can also edit and delete these heroes.

Furthermore, the app enables the storage and download of these heroes in editable PDF format, greatly facilitating the task of preparing and developing the characters.

This project has been developed by Leyre Gracia (LeyPopuli), but it wouldn't have been possible without:

1. The hero Daniel, my technical consultant and a place to cry equally.

2. The hero Jarko, who has supported and encouraged me at all times. Besides, sharing my passion for role-playing games.

3. My fellow heroes and the role-playing community, who have always shown interest in my work and given me the wings I needed.
